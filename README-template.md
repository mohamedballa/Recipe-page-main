## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
In this challenge i was able to build normalize css to have consistency throught the layout.  
Also use of css variables. over all it was reapplying what i learned(layout organization , the process of solving the problem by dividing it to small step)

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
	box-sizing: border-box;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
:root{
	/*variables*/
	--border-radius: 15px;
	--box-shadow: 15px 10px;
	--box-shadow-2: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
    0 4px 6px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); 
    /* other varialbes */
}
```


### Continued development

In the future I want to try more complex layout using felx box and Grid .

### Useful resources

mostly googling. high recomend kevin powell in youtube his channel is invaluable.
